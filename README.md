# ad-remediation
Scripts for Active Directory remediation.

Over a period, Active Directory may accumulate objects or permissions that are no longer required. These may present a security risk, or an obstacle to efficient administration. This repository provides a few sample scripts used for discovery and cleanup.

The purpose in providing the scripts is to support articles in the Airdesk blog at: https://airdesk.com/blog/. For any questions, contact the author at: https://airdesk.com/contact/.

The scripts are not intended as off-the-shelf tools for discovery in AD. Every organisation is different, and every AD will be different too. If you find the scripts useful, you may want to adapt them for your needs.
