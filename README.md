Scripts for Active Directory and Entra ID remediation.
Over a period, directories like Active Directory and Entra ID may accumulate objects or permissions that are no longer required. These may present a security risk, or an obstacle to efficient administration.
This repository provides a few sample scripts used for discovery and cleanup.
The purpose in providing the scripts is to support articles in the Airdesk blog at: https://airdesk.com/blog/.
